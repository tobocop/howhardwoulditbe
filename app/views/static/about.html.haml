        %h4.font-w300.font-midgray.font-height1p5.mtm We started Plink back in 2011 to provide people, just like us, an easier, more convenient way to get rewarded for all the money we spend. We all go out to eat and shop a lot, but who wants to carry around another loyalty card or clip coupons? Also, wouldn’t it be great if we could earn one type of reward across all the stores and restaurants we go to, so we get rewards faster? That’s Plink.
        %h4.font-w300.font-midgray.font-height1p5.mtm Plink eliminates the need to carry around extra cards or coupons. We link Plink rewards to a payment card that you already have. You just shop and dine out like always and watch the rewards pile up. And best of all, you’ll earn one reward currency at tons of locations nationwide and can pick the reward of your choice. That’s smarter shopping.
