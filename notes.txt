RISKS:
  could not get the test suite to work. Tried for 20 min or so but moved on
  new version of SQL adapters. New version of SQL server
  lots of pieces need to be running:
    * delayed job, elasticsearch - unknowns?
  Production setup will take a few hours, not sure about monitoring

took 1:30:00 min to get to loading the DB. Mostly around new OS with old gems. Had to upgrade our sql adapters for MS SQL 2014

30 min to get intuit working with CC bank
hour to get chase working and download transactions with real account


Tasks needed for working Beta:
  Deploy to production and make sure it 'works'
    * we made a readme, no idea what mileage we'll get out of it. It may be not to bad since the app setup readme was not bad
  Make a new flow and design for registration
  Write a process to load up all the institutions
  Write a process to rip down transactions for users
